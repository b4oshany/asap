	<h1>Welcome to ASAP</h1>
	<p>
	ASAP is a small database system that is split into two components, a web application and desktop application. The web version of ASAP will be integrated in OURVLE, whereby students will be doing their course assessment online and the results will be stored in an online database. The database will be then accessible by the desktop version of ASAP for further sorting, compilation, analysis and assessment of data from each and/or overall course assessment.
	ASAPs purpose is to resolve the tedious task of data collection, data tampering, data analysis and data evaluation. Therefore, it reduces the time taken to collect and process such large amount of data. Likewise, it increases the course assessment accuracy and reliability, since students will be forced to do the assessment on OURVLE in order for them to see their course resources.
